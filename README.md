# Cryptarithms

C program that solves a list of cryptarithms (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verbal_arithmetic) read on standard input. The program takes as argument the base in which the solver will perform the search (minimum 2, maximum 26).

It solves cryptarithms of the form <term 1> = ... = <term N>, each term being of the form <word 1> [ + ... + <word N> ] (see example inputs provided in the repository).
